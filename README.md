Iot based parking Mangement System help in a efficient parking space utilization

Arduino code is codded with C++ programming Language.The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is used as an add-on module in conjunction with an Arduino board to enable Wi-Fi connectivity. It provides Wi-Fi capabilities to Arduino boards that do not have built-in Wi-Fi functionality.

To implement the IoT-based car parking management system described in the code, you will need the following components:

1. Arduino Board: You can use an Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega, or any other compatible Arduino board.

2. Occupancy Sensor: You will need a sensor to detect the occupancy of parking spaces. Some common options include proximity sensors, ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors, or magnetic switches. Choose a sensor that suits your requirements and interface it with the Arduino board.

3. Wi-Fi Module: To enable communication between the Arduino board and the server, you will need a Wi-Fi module. The code provided assumes the use of the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, but you can also use other modules such as the ESP32 or Arduino Wi-Fi shield.

4. Server: You will need a server to receive updates from the Arduino and store the occupancy information. The server can be hosted on a computer or a cloud platform. The code assumes the server is already set up to handle incoming updates and respond accordingly.

5. Power Supply: Ensure you have an appropriate power supply for the Arduino board, sensor(s), and Wi-Fi module. This can include a USB cable connected to a computer or a separate power adapter.

6. Connecting Wires: Use jumper wires or appropriate connectors to establish connections between the Arduino board, sensor(s), and Wi-Fi module.

Make sure to consult the documentation and pin configurations for the specific components you are using, as the wiring and pin assignments may vary depending on the chosen components.
